#Start out by doing a simple Discord Bot in Python


#Start the code off by creating a connection to Discord in your code

#Next, have the your code interact with Discord's API

#Easiest interaction to start out with is having your bot print a message when joining a server, like welcoming new members


#Next you can try to programm the bot to respond to messages


#After that, try coding a few commands for the bot to take.
